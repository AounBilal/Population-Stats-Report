# Population-Stats-Report

Overview

The Population Reporting System is a C# application designed to retrieve and present population statistics from a world database. This system provides insights into demographic data, offering reports on countries, cities, and capital cities organized by population. Additionally, it includes features that allow users to generate customized reports based on specific criteria.

Project Details

Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a system using C# and MySQL that generates comprehensive reports on global population statistics. The key functionalities include:

Displaying population data for countries, cities, and capital cities sorted by population size.

Allowing users to define and view the top N most populated countries, cities, and capital cities.

Offering population distribution insights by continent, region, country, and city.

Presenting statistics on major language speakers, including Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, and Arabic.

System Features

1. Report Generation

Retrieve and display country, city, and capital city data sorted by population.

Generate user-defined top N reports for countries, cities, and capital cities.

Provide population distribution details at various levels (continent, region, country, and city).

2. Language Demographics

Report on the number of people speaking widely used languages such as:

Chinese

English

Hindi

Spanish

Arabic

3. Data Access and Population Insights

Retrieve population figures from different geographic levels, including continents, regions, and cities.

Offer data on individuals residing in urban areas versus those in rural settings.

4. Structured Reports

Country Report: Displays country code, name, continent, region, population, and capital city.

City Report: Provides city name, country, district, and population.
